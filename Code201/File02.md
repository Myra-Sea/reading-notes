## üìù Homework Assignments:

‚ùì _**Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**_

They are recognized and expected by client computers around the world.  Their function is known to the client device that is receiving your page from the server.  If you do not use them, then the element may not be interpreted correctly.  Two of the most impactful results will be to search engines and screen readers.

‚ùì _**How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**_

Six. `<h1>` is the main, top level heading, whereas `<h6>` is the smallest subheading.

‚ùì _**What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?**_

The superscript and subscript elements may be used when marking up items like dates, chemical formulas, and mathematical equations, in order for them to convey the correct meaning.  For example, X <sup>2</sup> quickly conveys the algebraic formula "*X to the power of 2*." It takes up less room on the client's screen than the potentially confusing shorthand `X^2` would use, and it is less likely to be misunderstood as being a label the way that something like `X2` might be confused as being.  As a similar example, H<sub>2</sub>O is universally recognized as conveying the chemical formula for water.

‚ùì _**When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**_

If the element is wrapped around an acronym, then a plain text expansion should normally follow in order to provide a hint to user agents about how to announce/display the content.  If the element is wrapped around an abbreviation, and the abbreviation is a fairly short word, then `title` can be included within the element in order to provide the full expansion.

For example, `<p>You should go ask <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbrev> Smith about that!</p>`
