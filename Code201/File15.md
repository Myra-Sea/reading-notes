# ü™∏ Psychological Safety Within Teams ü™∏

## üìù Assigned Homework Questions:

‚ùì What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Cooperation/compromise, good empathy skills (ie. social sensitivity), respect, safety of interpersonal risk-taking (ie. trust), and good listening skills ("equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking").

Quote by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson:
>"Shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.  A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or pumish someone for speaking up."

‚ùì Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.



‚ùì What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

The sum of the group together is greater than the individuals comprising it.  Success comes from the group experience, which includes emotional interactions and complicated conversations.
