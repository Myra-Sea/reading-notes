# ü™∏ Psychological Safety Within Teams ü™∏

## üìù Assigned Homework Questions:

‚ùì What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Cooperation/compromise, good empathy skills (ie. social sensitivity), respect, safety of interpersonal risk-taking (ie. trust), and good listening skills ("equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking").

Quote by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson:
>"Shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.  A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or pumish someone for speaking up."

‚ùì Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

This topic actually touches on a group situation in my life that has been difficult to explain to other group members adjacent to it.  The leader at the top of an organization I belong to constantly wonders, "Why can't you and the leader of your local group work well together in a classroom? You're both great people! I don't understand it!"  Yes, that local leader IS a good man when it comes to morals/etc, and I have said as much several times to many people, including to that questioning leader at the top.  That said, the local leader I have friction with also provides almost no psychological safety for me as a member of his group.  If I dare to ask a question it results in long-winded public chastizing by him about how my question is wasting time away from his lesson (the irony of which is that his long-winded rant actually takes a lot more time than a simple, direct answer would have); if I dare to express my opinion/thoughts about alternative tastes I have (towards either objects or towards the details of accomplishing things) he views it as a challenge to his authority and aggressively badmouths it in front of the class;  he refusest to acknowlede my presence even within online discussions the group has, and then there are also the behaviors of his that a couple of my loved ones have pointed out are outright personal bullying behaviors towards me by him. Many times, I have been able to see the hackles go up on him when I speak.  I noticed that I feel less trust towards him than I do towards complete strangers!  In short, there has been little to no psychological safety for me when I have attempted to be a member of the group that he leads.   ...Maybe I should send a link to this article to the man at the very top with a note saying "This is the answer you're looking for about why Derek and I can't work well together!" üòÜ

‚ùì What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

The sum of the group together is greater than the individuals comprising it.  Success comes from the group experience, which includes emotional interactions and complicated conversations.
