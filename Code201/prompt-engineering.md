>User: Tell me about jesses on a bird

>ChatGPT:  

*"Jesses" can refer to the leather straps or tethers used in the art of falconry, particularly when working with birds of prey such as falcons, hawks, and eagles. These straps are essential tools in controlling and handling these birds during training and hunting.*

*Jesses are typically made of soft and durable materials like leather. They are attached to a bird's legs or feet, just above the talons. The jesses are used for a variety of purposes in falconry:*

+ *Identification: Each bird may have a unique set of jesses, making it easier for the falconer to identify and keep track of their birds.*

+ *Control: Jesses allow the falconer to maintain control over the bird when it's not in flight. They can use the jesses to keep the bird tethered to a perch or to handle it safely.*

+ *Training: During training, jesses can be used to guide the bird or attach them to a leash for controlled practice flights. This is especially important for training birds to return to the falconer's glove or to hunt cooperatively.*

+ *Safety: Jesses can be used to prevent the bird from flying away during training or while out in the field. If a bird is on a kill, jesses can help secure the bird and prevent it from escaping before the falconer arrives.*

*Falconers are trained to handle jesses properly and ensure they do not harm or inconvenience the bird. The jesses are designed to be comfortable for the bird, and the falconer must regularly inspect and maintain them to prevent any issues.*

*In summary, jesses are a vital tool in the practice of falconry, allowing falconers to work with and train birds of prey effectively while ensuring the safety and well-being of the birds.*

>User: Elaborate on the inspection and maintenance requirements of them

>ChatGPT

*Inspecting and maintaining jesses in falconry is crucial to ensure the safety and comfort of the birds and to prevent accidents or injury. Here are some key aspects of inspection and maintenance of jesses:*

+ *Regular Inspection: Falconers should routinely inspect jesses to look for signs of wear and damage. This can be done daily, especially during the hunting season, and before each use. Inspection includes checking all components of the jesses, such as the leather straps, rivets, and attachments.*

+ *Leather Condition: The leather used for jesses should be soft and supple, as hard or brittle leather can cause discomfort or injury to the bird. Check for cracks, tears, or signs of drying out. If the leather is dry, it can be treated with leather conditioner or neatsfoot oil to keep it supple.*

+ *Stitching: Ensure that the stitching on the jesses is secure and not frayed. Stitching should be examined for signs of wear, and any loose or damaged stitches should be repaired.*

+ *Rivets and Grommets: The rivets or grommets used to fasten the jesses should be inspected for any signs of corrosion or wear. If any of them are loose or damaged, they should be replaced.*

+ *Attachment Points: The attachment points where the jesses are connected to the bird's legs should be checked for security. Make sure that the attachments, such as swivels, are functioning correctly and are not damaged or worn.*

+ *Length Adjustment: Jesses may need to be adjusted in length to accommodate the bird's legs comfortably. Ensure that the length is suitable for the bird and can be easily loosened or tightened as needed.*

+ *Cleaning: Keep jesses clean, as dirt and debris can accumulate on the leather. Cleaning can be done with a damp cloth and mild soap. Be sure to thoroughly dry them after cleaning to prevent mold or mildew from forming on the leather.*

+ *Replacement: If jesses are extensively damaged, it's advisable to replace them rather than attempting extensive repairs. Safety should always be the top priority when working with birds of prey.*

+ *Monitoring Behavior: Pay attention to the bird's behavior when wearing jesses. Signs of discomfort or distress, such as excessive leg lifting or chewing on the jesses, should be addressed promptly.*

+ *Record-Keeping: Falconers often keep records of jesses, noting their condition and any maintenance or replacement. This helps track the jesses' lifespan and ensures they are replaced when necessary.*

*Maintaining jesses is essential not only for the well-being of the bird but also for the effectiveness of falconry. Properly maintained jesses ensure that the bird remains under control and that training and hunting can be conducted safely. Falconers should be diligent in their inspection and maintenance practices to prevent accidents and discomfort for their birds of prey.*

>User: Neatsfoot oil?

>ChatGPT

*Neatsfoot oil is a traditional oil derived from the rendered shin and foot bones of cattle, particularly from the feet of cattle. It has been used for centuries as a conditioner and preservative for leather and other materials. Here are some key uses and characteristics of neatsfoot oil:*

+ *Leather Conditioner: Neatsfoot oil is primarily used to condition and soften leather. It helps to prevent leather from drying out, becoming brittle, and cracking. This is especially important for leather that is exposed to the elements or subject to regular wear and tear.*

+ *Water Repellent: Neatsfoot oil can make leather more water-resistant, which is useful for items like saddles, boots, and other outdoor gear. It helps leather repel water while still maintaining its breathability.*

+ *Restorer: It can also be used to restore old, dry, and stiff leather items. When applied to dry and hardened leather, neatsfoot oil can help rejuvenate and revitalize the material, making it supple and pliable again.*

+ *Non-Greasy: Neatsfoot oil is often preferred over some other leather conditioners because it tends to be less greasy or sticky when properly applied. It soaks into the leather rather than sitting on the surface.*

+ *Tack and Sporting Goods: Neatsfoot oil is commonly used by those involved in equestrian activities for conditioning and preserving horse tack, such as saddles, bridles, and harnesses. It's also used for maintaining other sporting goods like baseball gloves, soccer balls, and more.*

+ *Non-Leather Uses: While neatsfoot oil is primarily associated with leather, it can be used on other materials like canvas, wood, and some plastics to provide protection and conditioning.*

*It's important to note that there are different types of neatsfoot oil, including pure and compound versions. Pure neatsfoot oil is derived solely from the feet bones of cattle and is often preferred for high-quality leather items. Compound neatsfoot oil may contain additional ingredients, such as mineral oil, which can affect its properties and performance.*

*When using neatsfoot oil, it's essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions and apply it sparingly. Excessive use can darken some types of leather. Additionally, neatsfoot oil should not be used on suede or nubuck leather, as it can change the texture and appearance of these materials.*
