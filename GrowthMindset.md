# Growth Mindset

*Growth Mindset is an attitude/belief that new skills can be learned and improved on by anyone.  The concept centers around success being a controllable factor instead of being pre-determined by a person's genetics, etc.*

**To remain in a growth mindset:**

1. REMINDER 1:  Remain *positive* even when feeling challenged by failures
    > "Be led by the dreams in your heart." - Bennett
2. REMINDER 2:  Remain *persistent* by viewing failures as learning opportunities
    > "The outcome is determined by your effort"  - Yoshio
3. REMINDER 3: Remain *flexible* cognitively.  Avoid rigidly thinking in absolutes
    > "The future belongs to the elastic mind. When your mind is relaxed [...] you're not worried about why your ideas might be wrong.  You're not worried about failure.  You can experiment." - Mlodinow
