# HTML

*HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  It is a coding language used to structure the content of webpages.*

It consists of 3 elements: an **opening tag**, the **content** that will appear on the page, and a **closing tag**.

Extra information, such as styling, can be added using **attributes.**

Semantic elements label the structural purpose of the content they surround.  For example, a footer, header, or other section of the page.
