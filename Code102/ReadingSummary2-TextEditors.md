## Examples of Text-based Commands

`pwd` will display which directory you are currently in.  The letters stand for "print working directory"

`ls` will list the contents (the files and folders) of a directory

`cd` will change which directory you are in

`mkdir` will create a new directory

`touch` will create a new file

### For example...

The following string of commands
> ~ cd projects
>
> ~ mkdir new-project
>
> ~ touch new-project/newfile.md
>
> ~ cd ..
>
> ~ ls projects/new-project

### ...will result in...

1. Navigating to the projects directory
2. followed by then creating a new directory named "new-project"
3. followed by then creating a new .md file named "newfile" inside of that newly created "new-project" folder
4. followed by going back one level to the projects directory
5. and will conclude by listing all of the contents of the "new project" folder that's inside of the projects directory.  The only content should be that single "newfile" .md file
