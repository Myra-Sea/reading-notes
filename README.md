# reading-notes
Hello world!  My name is Myra Reeves.  I have lived in several locales in my life, including having been a Zonian when I was a young child.  I currently live in the southeastern farmland of the Puget Sound Area of Washington state.  I am a scholar level student in The 1595. Club historical fencing group, currently learning directly from the founder (Chris Chatfield) via Zoom but with occassional in-person learning from the Washington chapter inside of Lonin League in Seattle.  I welcome training partners. So if anyone wants to play with foam swords with me on Saturdays in Puyallup, WA, please reach out via Slack; no experience nor special level of physical fitness required!  I also volunteer at Woodland Park Zoo north of Seattle and enjoy playing D&D with groups down in Tacoma and Gig Harbor.

This is my reading journal for Code Fellows 102.


# Growth Midset
*Growth Mindset is an attitude/belief that new skills can be learned and improved on by anyone.  The concept centers around success being a controllable factor instead of being pre-determined by a person's genetics, etc.* 

**To remain in a growth mindset:**
1.  REMINDER 1:  Remain *positive* even when feeling challenged by failures
> "Be led by the dreams in your heart." - Bennett
2. REMINDER 2:  Remain *persistent* by viewing failures as learning opportunities 
> "The outcome is determined by your effort"  - Yoshio
3. REMINDER 3: Remain *flexible* cognitively.  Avoid rigidly thinking in absolutes
> "The future belongs to the elastic mind. When your mind is relaxed [...] you're not worried about why your ideas might be wrong.  You're not worried about failure.  You can experiment." - Mlodinow
