# About Markdown

*Markdown is a way to format text using symbols (computer syntax symbols) in a visually unobtrusive way.*  

It is designed to be simple, readable, and versatile.  It can be used on any operating system and can be interpreted by most software programs.  This makes it easy to move (copy & paste) markdown-formatted text between different applications.  The readability of it also helps preserve the content of markdown-formatted files into the future.

As a result of all of the above, it has become extremely popular.

## Examples of Basic Markdown Syntax
:memo: `#` to create a heading

The number of marks denotes the level of the heading.  Use one # for a top level heading, two for the next level below, etc., all the way down to six #'s for the lowest level heading. 

:memo: `**` to bold text
