# About Markdown

 *Markdown is a way to format text using symbols (computer syntax symbols) in a visually unobtrusive way.*

It is designed to be simple, readable, and versatile.  It can be used on any operating system and can be interpreted by most software programs.  This makes it easy to move (copy & paste) markdown-formatted text between different applications.  The readability of it also helps preserve the content of markdown-formatted files into the future.

As a result of all of the above, it has become extremely popular.

## Examples of Basic Markdown Syntax
:computer: `#` at the start of a line creates a heading

+ The number of # used denotes the level of the heading.  Use one # for the largest (top level) heading, two for the next level below that, three for the third level below, etc., etc., all the way down to six #'s in a row for the smallest (lowest level) heading. 
+ It is best to place a space after the # sign, to avoid compatibility issues.
+ It is also best to place a blank line after a heading.    

:computer: `**` surrounding text causes it to be **bold**   
+ You can also surround text using __ two underscores __ to create the same effect but it may not work if the bold part is in the middle of a word.  Therefore, using ** is best practice.
+ Regardless of which symbol is used, there should not be any space between it and the word you wish to make bold.

:computer: `*` surrounding text causes it to be *italic*    
+ You can also surround text using _ one underscore _ to create the same effect, but it may not work if the italic part is in the middle of a word.  Therefore, using * is best practice.
+ Regardless of which symbol is used, there should not be any space between it and the word you wish to make italic.

:computer: `*` or `+` or `-` at the start of each line creates an unordered list
+ It is best to pick one within a file and stick with it throughout.
+ They can be nested by using indentation.

:computer: `[ ]` surrounding the desired hyperlink displayed text followed immediately by `( )` surrounding the url creates a link
+ There should not be any space between the closing bracket and the opening parenthesis.  It should look like ]( 

:computer: `>` at the start of a line creates a block quote
+ Quotes can be nested using >>
+ It is best to place a blank line before and after a block quote.
