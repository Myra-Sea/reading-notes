CSS is the language used for styling HTML elements.  If you don't have the HTML element in your HTML file then you will never see that specific CSS style instruction.

Classes and IDs are used in CSS to target specific HTML elements in order to style them.

CSS defines rules that will be applied to HTML elements.  It defines the rule that will be used when you reference either that element or that unique CSS tag.
  + For example, if you wanted to make the text of all paragraphs on the page red colored, the CSS code would be `p {color: red}`

CSS syntax (its language rules) uses curly braces `{`

Structure of a CSS Rule <sup>(this structure is used regardless of what HTML element is being targeted and also whatever styles are being applied to that element)</sup>:
1. _**Selector**_: Identify the HTML element you want to select
2. Opening curly bracket: `{`
3. _**Property**_: The aspect being manipulated or modified for that element
4. The colon symbol: `:`
5. A blank space
6. _**Value**_
7. The semicolon symbol: `;`
8. Closing curly bracket: `}`

A typical, highly readable line break choice when writing the code is like this: 
>selector {
>
>property1: value;
>
>property2: value;
>
>property3: value;
>
>}

**ALL** elements are made up of 4 areas, each nested inside of the last one, forming the _**CSS Box Model**_:  Margin (on the outside), Border, Padding, and Content (on the inside)

Use of a `*` as the selector means that the values will be applied to all html elements on the page.  For example, writing `* { border: 2px solid black;}` would result in being able to clearly see the box outline of every element on the page.

There are a few different ways you can set up the CSS rules to apply to the HTML page, depending on your styling needs:

+ A single setting can be applied to all instances of a standard, typical element (like paragraph `<p>` tags, for instance) on the page
  + For example, `li {background-color: purple;}` would make the background of ALL list items on the page purple in color
  + `img {width: 50%;}` would make all images on the page 50% the size of their parent container
  + Nesting can also be done within this method.  So, for example, `main img {width: 50%;}` would cause all the images within the main to be 50% of the size of their parent container, and `main section img {width: 50%;}` would cause all the images within the section portions of the main to be 50% of the size of their parent container, etc. etc.
  + Nesting is helpful when it comes to setting values for only navigation menu contents because there tends to only be one navigation menu per page.  So, for instance, the links inside the navigation menu, which use an unordered list format (`<nav>   <ul>  <li><a href="url">Link 1</a></li>    <li><a href="url">Link 2</a></li>   <li><a href="url">Link 3</a></li>   </ul>   </nav>`) can be easily targeted with their `<li>` tags because they are inside of the `<nav>` tags.  The CSS would be `nav li {...}`

+ **Classes** can be used multiple times

+ **IDs**, on the other hand, are unique.  The name you create should not be in use anywhere else in the hTML or CSS code.
  + This format uses `#` in the CSS and the attribute `id` in the HTML
  + For example, if you wanted an orange background for only the top portion of the main, in the HTML file you could write `<section id="top-section">` and then in the CSS file you would write `#top-section {background-color: orange;}`
  + Nesting can also be done using a section id.  So, for example, `#top-section img {width: 25%;}` would cause all the images inside of only the top-section labelled elements to be 50% the width of that container.

There are three way to be able to incorporate CSS into an HTML file
* External Stylesheet:  The industry best practice of putting all the CSS into its own separate file
* Internal Styles:  Places the CSS code itself directly inside of the HTML document
* Inline **Styles**:  Places the instructions inside the element itself. It will therefore be written in HTML

With incorporating CSS using an **external stylesheet**, use the following format in the HTML file.  Best practice is to place this in the head section:
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`
Meaning:  link (What is it being linked to? Answer: a stylesheet) href (name of your CSS file)
+ Each html file within the website would need that set of instructions placed in the head.

When adding **internal styles**, use the following HTML format in the head section instead:
`<style> selector {property: value;} </style>`

The browser is reading the HTML instructions in order.  Because it is placed on a later line in the code than the external stylesheet link, the internal style will replace what the instructions from the external stylesheet had been.  The internal style is the one that will be shown from that point in the HTML code onward.  A weak analogy but one that I can think of would be like the set of instructions for creating a scratch off art surface: The first part of the instructions (the external stylesheet) would say to paint the entire piece of paper a rainbow of different colors, and then the next part of the instructions (internal style) would say to paint the entire piece of paper chalk black, resulting in black being all that is seen in the end (at least until someone uses the paper to make scratch art).
  
An example of **inline style** would be `<body style="background-color: green;>"....</body>`
Any inline styles written in the code after internal styles would replace the internal style for the same reason as was explained above.

 ðŸŽ¨ Ways of expressing colors: 
+ **RGB** value (amount of red coloration, amount of green, amount of blue)
+ **HSV** percentage (the location in degrees of the hue on the [color wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel), % darkness, % lightness)  
+ **HSL** percentage
+ **HEX** code 

To make an image have rounded edges, use `border-radius` as the property and then set a % value.

Every HTML element has a default display value. Two display value styles are:
+ **Block** level elements are stacked one on top of each other, like building blocks.
+ **Inline** elements
