## 102 Lecture Notes

CSS is the language used for styling HTML elements.  If you don't have the HTML element in your HTML file then you will never see that specific CSS style instruction.
+ Classes and IDs are used in CSS to target specific HTML elements in order to style them.
+ It defines rules that will be applied to HTML elements.  It defines the rule that will be used when you reference either that element or that unique CSS tag.
  + For example, if you wanted to make the text of all paragraphs on the page red colored, the CSS code would be `p {color: red}`

CSS syntax (its language rules) uses curly braces `{`

**Classes** can be used multiple times

**IDs**, on the other hand, are unique.

### Additional Credit:

The phrasing used inside the 102 Lecture Notes section often originates from how CodeFellows instructor Kassie Bradshaw phrased her explanations of the concepts to us during lectures.  Thank you for being an amazing teacher, Kassie! ðŸ’œ
