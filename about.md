# About Me

![This is a photo of myself](GitHub1.jpg)

Hello world!  My name is Myra Reeves.

I have lived in several locales in my life, including having been a Zonian when I was a young child.  I currently live in the southeastern farmland of the Puget Sound Area of Pierce County in Washington state.

In my past, I spent decades working with wild animals, in a variety of field and zoological settings.  The work involved a huge range of species (and even a few domesticated animals!) but the ones I ended up working the most with were marine mammals and birds of prey.

I am a scholar level student in [The 1595. Club](https://www.the1595club.com/) historical fencing group, currently learning directly from the founder (Chris Chatfield) via Zoom but with occassional in-person learning from the Washington chapter inside of [Lonin League](https://www.lonin.org/) in Seattle.  I welcome training partners. So if anyone wants to play with foam swords with me on Saturdays in Puyallup, WA, please feel free to reach out.  There isn't any special level of physical fitness nor any prior martial arts experience required!

This summer (2023), I also joined the [Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)](https://www.sca.org/new-to-the-sca/) and have been participating in weekly archery practice with a recurved bow.

Lastly, I enjoy playing D&D with groups in Tacoma and Gig Harbor.  My go-to character choice is usually a halfling.  However, currently I am playing a tiefling instead. A tiefling who is a True Nuetral bard sailor named Nocturne with proficiency in the fiddle (so that [she can defeat the devil just like Charlie Daniels' Johnny character did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh7BZf7D5Bw), the banjo (just like [Amigo the Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYDQWED6fKw), and the hand drums (because [hand drums made sense as the final choice to round things out in a sailor/pirate sort of way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMOyOlmBYCU).

Nice to meet you!
