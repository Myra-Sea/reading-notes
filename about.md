# About Me

![This is a photo of myself](GitHub1.jpg)

Hello world!  My name is Myra Reeves.

I have lived in several locales in my life, including having been a Zonian when I was a young child.  I currently live in the southeastern farmland of the Puget Sound Area of Washington state.

I am a scholar level student in [The 1595. Club](https://www.the1595club.com/) historical fencing group, currently learning directly from the founder (Chris Chatfield) via Zoom but with occassional in-person learning from the Washington chapter inside of [Lonin League](https://www.lonin.org/) in Seattle.  I welcome training partners. So if anyone wants to play with foam swords with me on Saturdays in Puyallup, WA, please feel free to reach out.  There isn't any special level of physical fitness nor prior martial arts experience required!

I also volunteer at Woodland Park Zoo north of Seattle and enjoy playing D&D with groups down in Tacoma and Gig Harbor.
